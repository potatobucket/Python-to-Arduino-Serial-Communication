# Python to Arduino Serial Communication
 Communicating with the Arduino through Python

 ## TODO:
  - Figure out how to push the text data to the Arduino in a way it likes.
  - Find out how many different sizes text can be on the OLED screen.
    - Reconfigure the code to automatically set the word wrap based on the size of the text on the OLED screen.
  - Figure out how to send ~1kb of data to push a 128x64 bitmap to the OLED screen via the Arduino.

 ## Examples:
 The bitmap is the image data I plan to push to the OLED screen. The text is a successful test of using serial communication to push text to the screen.
